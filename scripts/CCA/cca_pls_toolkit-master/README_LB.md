# CCA/PLS Toolkit - LB edited

Example for running CCA with CCA-PLS toolkit is in 'RunCCA.m'

Input data must be stored in project-specific-folder/data/ within CCA-PLS toolkit folder (don't sync this with Github using .gitignore file)

Also added 'calc_weights.m' script for extracting weights/loadings for plotting CCA results using 'CCA_plots.m' script.
